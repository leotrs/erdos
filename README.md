# Erdos

### http://erdosnet.work/

Erdos is a site with educational problem sets of increasing difficulty for
learning about
[Network Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science). Erdos has
been inspired by projects like [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
for math and programming, [ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/about/) for
bioninformatics, and [the cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)
for cryptography.
